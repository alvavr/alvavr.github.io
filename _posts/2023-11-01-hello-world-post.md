At my 34 I have vast experience in the digital world. From back then, when I was a kid and used to download games and mods from shady websites, to this day, when I work full time as a data engineer building data solutions to my clients. However, there are still things that even now in 2023 I haven't tried yet, one of them is -you guessed it- writing a blog. 

So, this is my ~~late~~ take on blogging. One in which I would try to organize and combine both professional experience and my passion, which is Surf.

## Motivation
I am currently studying a master's degree in data science and artificial intelligence at a prestigious university in Madrid, Spain. And while sharing experiences with professors and classmates, everyone was talking about getting a portfolio out of the master's program. I didn't pay too much attention at first, after all, I never felt the need for it, since when I started my career (12 years ago) there was a high demand for data professionals and software engineers, and after a while I was always hired through contacts that I have worked with in the past and know my work very well. But after giving some thought to it, I decided it was not a bad idea after all, because I could give it a twist and not making it just about a portfolio, but rather my own personal space in which I could share my hobbies, life experiences living abroad (didn't I mentioned I'm from Chile?) and thoughts in general about the data industry (and I will have a special mention to those "Linked In influencers").

My second motivation for this project, is the fact that I am living abroad in a foreign country, and writing here could be helpful for my own mental health, since I am in the process of making new friends, discovering new places and adapting to culture shocks. Don't worry, you won't find "dear diary" post here, I will save you the cringe.

## Project idea
As it was briefly mentioned before, this website will be divided intro three main categories: Personal blog post, Technical blog post and portfolio projects.

### Technical Blog Posts
Technical notes or tutorials I consider to be useful for my future self (and if this helps a random stranger, even better).

Also, my personal thoughts about the state of the industry, technologies and concepts, such as data science, data lakes, artificial intelligence, among others (oh, does anyone remember something called "decision support systems" or DSS for short?). 

### Personal Blog Posts
This section will have content about my hobbies, and opinions about the city and life in general. I'll try to organize everything with proper categories for easy navigation.

### Portfolio
At first, I will leave here work I have done for my master's assignments. Then, I will also put here my personal projects, and finally (if I could get authorization), I will publish here work I have done for actual clients.

## Website theme
The name "Swell: data" is all about combining my greatest passion, which is Surf, and my work (which I also love).

As you might know, surf can only be done when mother nature bless us with waves. And when that happen every surfer struggles to decide which beach to go, at what time it best, which equipment to carry, etc. With today data related trends I feel the same is happening, everyone (myself included) is struggling trying to make sense of the vast amount of data concepts, technologies and products popping out every single day.

## Audience
Everyone is welcome!

Shaka's to everyone.
